    "# Notebook 1: NARA 1950 Census Image Downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use AWS CLI commands to access data from the National Archives (NARA). With these commands we'll be able to target and download all of the schedule images (i.e., the scanned census forms) from one or more specific counties within a state. (2) Next, we'll create folders based on the enumeration districts for the selected county and save the images into their respective folders. File and folder names will be based on the JSON files that describe the data housed in NARA. This code will save the schedule images as well as the map images for the associated county. This code can be modified to save images from any county, state combination.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Saving all of the images from NARA will take a significant amount of time. (3) This code includes a loop that will check which files have already been downloaded and will continue wherever it left off. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this notebook will produce the following output: a folder structure with all of the census data (i.e., scanned images) for a given county/state in the 1950 census. The main folder housing all of the data is called \"NARA_downloads_1950\" (can be changed) and the sub-folders are named after the enumeration disctrict (in this case, \"70-1\", \"70-2\", etc.). Within each folder named after an enumeration disctrict are two folders called \"Description Images\" (contains the same information in each enumeration disctrict folder) and \"Schedule Images\" (contains scanned images of the completed census form(s) for that enumeration district). Last, the \"NARA_downloads_1950\" will also include the json file for the state (in this case, California) and a folder called \"Map_Images\" with the maps of the selected county/state."

The good news is that there is a small number of map images per county so the workaround would be using a command with AWS CLI to download each image in the folder housing the images (\"1950census-maps/California/Sacramento\"). We can reference the JSON file to see which map images are unique to the city of Sacramento in Sacramento county and manually remove any unnecessary files. In the JSON file, simply find the county/city you're interested in - so 44 in the case of Sacramento, Sacramento - and then look under 'enumeration' > '0' > 'map_image'. The city of Sacramento has 193 enumeration districts for the 1950 census, but since they are all pointing to the same map we can just look at the first district (at index 0 in the JSON file) to check which image files we need to keep. In this case, we only need 14-a2-025-00459.jpg and 14-a2-025-00459b.jpg."
