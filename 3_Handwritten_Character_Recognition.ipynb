    "# Handwritten Character Recognition: Using Machine Learning to Detect a 'W' in the demographic column\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds upon the image processing work in the document segmentation notebook. The code from that notebook has been consolidated into a file called 'segmentation.py' and will be imported for use in this notebook. This notebook will demonstrate a machine learning approach to recognizing handwritten characters, using a layered *neural network* that is trained on the publically available EMNIST letters dataset. The E in EMNIST stands for Extended, as it is an extended version of the MNIST dataset, which is the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) dataset of handwritten digits. Before you can train a machine learning model (or neural network) on the digit dataset you have to download it from the NIST website. Lucky for us, the Keras toolkit now includes functions that automate the download of the dataset the first time that you use it. Be forewarned that this code will take a long time to execute the first time, depending upon your network speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is partially based on the [Keras MNIST tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AviatorMoser/keras-mnist-tutorial/blob/master/MNIST%20in%20Keras.ipynb) written by Daniel Moser (UT Southwestern Medical Center). We modify their approach to focus on letters exclusively and explore training a NN and Convolutional NN (CNN) to specialize in recognizing the W character alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Dependencies\n",
    "The first step is to install some necessary Python libraries for machine learning. We are using the Google suite of tools, which include *TensorFlow* and *Keras*, which is a somewhat simpler API that wraps the base functions provided by TensorFlow. Please Note: There is a strange situation with Keras version 3 that requires it to be installed (or reinstalled) after you install tensorflow. (TensorFlow tries to install it's own earlier version of Keras.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to restart your kernel after these tools have installed."

Instead of removing ink from the Census images, we are going to try adding similar ink to the training and testing data from EMNIST. This seems counterintuitive to us because we associate letters with concepts and their particular shapes. To a machine learning model these letters are simply patterns of pixels. We'll train a model to recognize letters with noisy lines added to them and this will be easier that removing those lines using computer vision techniques.\n",

    "We use the same *map()* operation to add noise to the EMNIST images. One thing to note here is that while we are dealing with 28x28 pixel images, the TensorFlow datasets are provided as matrices with three dimensions. This is because the images are provided as batches, with multiple images provided in one larger matrix. Hence the functions we are mapping below have to deal in three dimensional inputs and outputs."

This can be pretty confusing to those new to TensorFlow and makes it harder to interpret training error messages about the shape and dimensionality of the training data.\n",

    "## Defining and Training a Machine Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to define the most straightforward machine learning model first and customize it for our parameters and the output we want. This model is defined as a sequence that takes in a 28 by 28 tensor array. The input is first flattened into a 784 long tensor array of one dimension (28 times 28). Then each of these *input features* is connected to each of the units in the subsequent neural network layer. The dense NN layer stores weights associated with each of these connections and those weights are used to determine the value each unit will pass to the next layer in the model. These weights are adjusted during training. An activation formular (relu) is supplied to this layer. The default activation formation is \"linear\", which means that unit output pretty directly reflect input and weights. Our activation formula of [ReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/ReLU) means that unit output never exceeds a certain maximum value and that any unit output below a certain threshold is attenuated, or lessened. This privileges the output of units that are strongly weighted and also receiving input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit in the first dense layer is subsequently connected to all of the 27 units in the last dense layer. The activation there is *softmax*, not ReLU. [Softmax](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/softmax) is an activation that converts the output vector or 27 possibilities into a probability distribution, where all of the output values sum to 1. That makes it easier to compare the confidence of a model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you defined the neural network structure and activations in the first step, you compile that model, adding an optimizer, a loss function, and a metrics function. The loss function compare each prediction to the expected result in the training data. The model will be trained in steps to minimize this loss. Our loss function is categorical, which means that the model is judged on how well it chooses a category (a letter) based on the input it receives. The summary function prints a nice display of the model we have constructed."

Then in the next layer you have 128 outputs connected to 27 units, for 128 x 27 weights, or 3,483 parameters. The total therefore is 103,963 trainable connections between inputs and neuron units.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our next step is to attempt to use the model to predict if a Census image is a 'W' or not. Let's try that with the model we've just trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is an improvement on some of the *run()* functions we have used before in the image segmentation notebook. This run function takes a folder path, a page range, and a model. Since the census images we downloaded are named with a series of page numbers encoded after a final hyphen, such as \"43290879-California-101393-0014.jpeg\", we can use a regular expression to detect if a page is within the range of integers desired. If it is not, then we simply skip it. The *glob()* function will return files within the desired folder path and the *sort()* function will ensure that those files are returned in the right page order.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have a page image file we read in the image with OpenCV *imread()*. The image is passed to the *extract()* function from the `segmentation.py` file, which returns the properly positioned template for the main part of the census form as well as a deskewed and adjusted image we can use to extract cell images. We then use the template to calculate a list of rectangles or boxes that represent demographic cells from the census page (`demographic_cells`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each demographic cell, we crop a little image out of the page image (`cell_img`). We crop the cell image down to a 28x28 pixel square, using the *moments()* function to grab the most ink possible without exceeding the edges of the little cell image. The 28x28 square is then normalized, just like our training data, into a tensor of floating point values. This tensor is expanded with an empty third dimension, just so that it matches our training data, which was three dimensions after it was batched. Having done this last step, we can finally call the *predict()* function and see what the model says about the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a tensor array of 27 floating point values that represent the probability distribution among the 27 possible categories, i.e. letters. You can print out the full result tensor if that is interesting to you. Our code selects the index with the maximum probability (highest value). For each page we plot all of the demographic cells in a 6 by 5 grid, with a view of each 28x28 cropped cell image and caption that includes the class (integer label), the letter (looked up in a list), and the probability value of the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a good look at the resulting plots of images and their predicted categories. What sort of image features impact predictions and their confidence? Are all of the 'W's predicted accurately? What other letters are often predicted instead of 'W' and why?"

    "In the results above you can probably see several instances where a 'W' image was predicted to be some other letter. There may be some remaining way to improve the accuracy of the model's predictions, such as a more true to life \"noisy line\" rendering, or a more sophisticated model. However, any model is going to be less than 100% on real world data. As you can see, many census demographic cells contain what look like meaningless scribbles without the context of the page. Recorders would often make notes in the unused portion of the main table of a page, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that any model will be imperfect, what can we do to make these results more useful? Stop and think about that question and remember that our goal in using this 'W' detector is to save time on manual transcription tasks. If we can quickly review and skip pages that do not contain the target demographic for transcription, then we will save considerable time and mental load.\n",

    "## Making Partial Predictions More Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several steps we can take that will make our predictions more useful in filtering data for manual transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter out all of the known 'W' characters. There is no need to show people images of demographic cells that we are sure are 'W' characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter out all the cells where 'W' was a significant probability. Even though the model may predict another character is more likely than a 'W', we often see that a 'W' is in second place, in terms of probability. A quick review of these situations indicates that in most cases, with respect to our census demographic data, these second place 'W' predictions are correct. So we can probably filter out the cells where 'W' is the second most predicted character.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our task is really to collect page references for further analysis by a human being, who will look at the whole page. If we can help a person focus on the few cells that may or may not contain a targetted demographic code (\"Jap\" is the demographic code for Japanese, in our case), then a person can either say yes or no to saving that page reference for further analysis. In other words, even though we may have up to 30 cell images to review, we only need one answer for the entire page, which is \"save\" or \"ignore\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can implement something like this in our *run()* function. First we will filter out all the known 'W' cells and cells where 'W' is a significant second place prediction, say greater than 15%."
